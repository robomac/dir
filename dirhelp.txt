dir, A better directory lister.
    dir {flags} {start path}{/}{filemask}

    Flags are denoted by -, but many can also be denoted, DOS-style, as switches with /

Filters:
    cs = Case-Sensitive file mask. e.g. "-cs F*" will not match "file", while omitting "-cs" will.

    m{a|c|d|s}=v:v  Min/Max values for file accessed/create/modification date or size.  
        e.g. -md=2023-02-01:2023-03-31
        Only that date format is accepted; times are not accepted. Only one date filter can be applied.
        If only one value and no colon is present, it will be the minimium.
        An empty value implies no bound, e.g. -ms=:500000 would look for files less than or 500000 bytes.
    t{c|i|r}=v text search - case sensitive, insensitive or regex.  Don't forget to disable globbing!
        Searches for the specified text in the files, only returning matching files.  This may be SLOW.
        If combined with -z, listing files inside archives, it will do a text scan on files in the archives,
        expanding MS Office and PDF files into $TEMP as necessary, which may also be slow.  
        So use -t{c|i|r} with -z cautiously.
        Note: If needing to quote - e.g. embedded spaces - put the entire flag in quotes, e.g. "-ti= the "
        This is distinct from -t, which prints totals without filenames.
        e.g. dir -ti=rAt *.txt will find txt files with RAT, rat or any combination.
    x=v,v... (or exclude=) Comma-separated list of extensions to skip over.  E.g. avoid text-search on 
        MOV, MP4 files.  Case-insensitive.  This can make text searching a lot faster.
    xd=v,v... Comma-separated list of directories to skip recursing into. Does not support wild-cards or fragments.

Visibility:
    d{+|-} = List Directories.  + is ONLY list directories, - exludes them.  Default is list files and directories.
    ah- = hide hidden files.  They are shown by default.

Recursion:
    r = recurse subdirectories (i.e. /s in MS-DOS.)
    z = recurse into archives (zip, tgz, tar.gz, 7z files.)  Not all archive formats are supported, 
        not all compression nor nested archives, and of course no support for encrypted archives.
        A single archive can be searched by specifying it, including the extension, plus a slash and the 
        file spec.
        e.g. dir -z foo.zip/* will list all files in foo.zip
        e.g. dir -z ~/Downloads/big.zip/readme* will find all readme* files in big.zip.
        e.g. dir -z ~/Downloads/readme*  will find all readme* files in all archives in Downloads.
    Hint: Format for recursion if sorting, such as: dir -r -cr -G- -pad=50 | sort
        This turns on recursion, outputs name folder modified, turns off colors (for sorting) 
        and pads the name so it lines up.
    

Sort Order:
    o{-}{n|t|x|a|c|d|s} = sort order.  n = name, t = type, x = extension, a = access, c = created, d = modified, s = size
        - reverses the order to descending.  (This is -r in ls.)
        e.g. /o-n lists in reverse alpha.
        type lumps by extension classification, if found, and then by extension and name.

Output Formatting:
    c="{acmlnps?}" = Field and output formatting. Default: "p   m  (c)  s   nl"
        Fields:
            a: Last Accessed Time
            c: Created Time
            f: Folder-path (path to file - good with recursion.)
            l: Link Target, if applicable.
            m: Modified Time
            n: File Name
            p: Permissions (mode) 
            s: File size
        Any other character is quoted verbatim - e.g. spaces and parenthesis in the default.

    cd = show all dates, same as -c="c   m   a  s   nl"
    cr = recursion-format, same as -c="n  m  f" plus -pad=30 and -b-
         Hint: If piping to sort, use -G- to suppress colors.

    ct = Text-search output; lists matches after filename listing.
         Note that this WILL slow search down, as it will find ALL matches in a file
         rather than just the first one.

    s{c|h|r} = file size formatting.
        sc = Use commas as thousands-separators.  In ls, this is -,
        sh = Abbreviate the size to KB, MB or GB as appropriate.  In ls, this is -h.
        sr = Regular size listing - i.e. just the long number.

    G{|-|+} = Color output.  - = no colors, + is "enhanced", using additional file-type colors.
        + (enhanced) is the default if LS_COLORS is defined.  Regular (non-enhanced) would just be "-G"
           
           Note that this ignores extension-configuration of LS_COLORS, e.g. export LS_COLORS=$LS_COLORS:"*.ogg=01;35":"*.mp3=01;35"
           Instead we have a custom extension to it, ac for archives, au for audio and im for image/video files.

    H = Column Headers - i.e. "Name", "Created", etc. Default is off.

    b{+} = bare (filenames only, e.g. for use with xargs or other inputs), one per line.  
        b+ includes the path to the filename.
        Note that b omits coloring, while -c=n would retain coloring.
    b- = Suppress directory headers and totals, but otherwise follow default or output formatting options.
    pad=# Pads the file name and folder (directory) name to the specified number of spaces.
    t = Totals only, no filenames/listing.


Other output commands:
    debug == Print debug messages.    
    errors == show all error messages; usually they're quiet.
    version == print the version (probably the build date)

    Both -debug and -error should be first on the cmd line, as they don't take effect until parsed.

    Note, if you're coming from DOS, that you may have to quote wildcards to prevent zshell/bash from globbing (interpreting - also called expansion) them.
    Globbing is what lets ~ equate to $HOME, and a lot of other niceties, but zsh pretty aggressively does it by default
    Or preface the command with noglob, perhaps in an alias.  

Example:
    dir -r -z -x=mov,mp4,gif,jpeg,jpg -ti=christmas
        Would search from the current directory down for files with the word "Christmas" with any casing, SKIPPING movie/graphic files,
        but looking inside MS Office (DOCX), PDF and ZIP files.
