dir, A better directory lister.
    dir {flags} {start path}{/}{}filemask}

    Flags are denoted by -, but many can also be denoted, DOS-style, as switches with /

    o = sort order.  - to reverse.  n == name, t or x == extension/type, d == modified, s == size
    e.g. /o-n lists in reverse alpha.

    d = List Directories.  /d+ is ONLY list directories, /d- is DON'T include them.
    ah- = hide hidden files.  They are shown by default.
    r = recurse subdirectories (i.e. /s in MS-DOS.)
    cs = turn case-sensitivity on for both sorting and masking.
    G{-} = turn colors on or off.  If LS_COLORS is defined, colors AND audio/image/archive colors default to on, using those.  
           Override this with G-.  If you don't have LS_COLORS, or you don't want enhanced colors, defaults can be used with G.
           If you do want enhanced colors but don't have LS_COLORS, G+ will force the defaults.
           
           Note that this ignores extension-configuration of LS_COLORS, e.g. export LS_COLORS=$LS_COLORS:"*.ogg=01;35":"*.mp3=01;35"
           Instead we have a custom extension to it, ac for archives, au for audio and im for image/video files.
    b{+} = bare (filenames only, e.g. for use with xargs or other inputs.)  b+ includes the path to the filename.
    t = Totals only, no filenames/listing.

Other output commands:
    debug == Print debug messages.    
    errors == show all error messages; usually they're quiet.
    version == print the version (probably the build date)

    Both -debug and -error should be first on the cmd line, as they don't take effect until parsed.

    Note, if you're coming from DOS, that you may have to quote wildcards to prevent zshell/bash from globbing (interpreting - also called expansion) them.
    Globbing is what lets ~ equate to $HOME, and a lot of other niceties, but zsh pretty aggressively does it by default
    Or preface the command with noglob, perhaps in an alias.
